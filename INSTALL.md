# Installation

## Manual

Put the mkbash file on a location within your `PATH`:

* To install it system-wide, put it inside `/usr/bin`.

* To install it only for yourself, put it e.g. in a folder `~/.bin` and add the following line to the bottom of your `~/.bashrc` (create the file it if it's not present):
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:"~/.bin
```

## Automatic

May be coming soon, who knows?
